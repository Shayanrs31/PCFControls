# PCFControl - Quick Update Record

# Problem:
In the current dynamics model driven app scenario, in order to update values in the lookup record, the user should actually navigate to the lookup(related record) from the existing entity and then update the record. 


# Developed solution:
This control is built using office fabri ui and react js, that opens a pop up in the same window allowing users to edit values related to lookup record.
